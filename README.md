Quickly generate the phpDoc for your Eloquent Model. Make your Eloquent super friendly with IDEs (eg PHPStorm).

And maintaining the phpDoc of your models don't have to be a pain in the ass, should be:

- Fun
- Fast
- Reliable

And, welcome to Eloquent phpDoc Generator, which going to help you to achieve the 3 points above ðŸŽ‰

## What will Eloquent phpDoc Generator will generate?
- Table name
- Table columns (with types)
- Model relationships
- Model attributes/accessors

## Requirements
- PHP 8+ (yes it is 2022, PHP8 is superfast)
- Laravel 9 (tested)
- Laravel 8 (untested but very likely work without any issues)

## Install
Install as dev-dependencies is enough, since you are only going to use this command on `local/development` env.

```bash
composer require sethphat/eloquent-docs --dev
```

Laravel auto-discovery will automatically do the magic for you. So you don't have to worry ðŸ˜‰.

## Use the command

```bash
php artisan eloquent:phpdoc App\Models\User # view only
php artisan eloquent:phpdoc App\Models\User --write # view & write to file
php artisan eloquent:phpdoc App\Models\User --short-class # new option - use short class instead of full namespace path
```

Result:

<details>

```bash
====== Start PHPDOC scope of App\Models\User
/**
* Table: users
*
* === Columns ===
* @property int $id
* @property string $name
* @property string $email
* @property \Carbon\Carbon|null|null $email_verified_at
* @property string $password
* @property string|null $remember_token
* @property \Carbon\Carbon|null $created_at
* @property \Carbon\Carbon|null $updated_at
*
* === Relationships ===
* @property-read \App\Models\Emails[]|\Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection|null $emails
* @property-read \App\Models\UserDetails|null $userDetail
*
* === Accessors/Attributes ===
* @property-read string $full_name
* @property-read string $is_admin
* @property-read string $user_type
* @property-read int $total_salary
* @property-read mixed $levels
* @property-read mixed $first_name
* @property-read mixed $last_name
*/

Thank you for using SethPhat/EloquentDocs!
```

</details>

Note: if you haven't installed `doctrine/dbal` as your dev-dependency, 
then once you trigger the command for the first time, it will help you to install the needful dependency

## Best practices
- Use `$casts` in your model, in order to help EloquentPhpDoc generate better types for you (array, Carbon,...)
- For `get*Attribute` accessor, always declare the return type

Note: Eloquent new `Attribute` class utilize the data via Closure, thus we can't declare any return type for any attributes.
For this case, EloquentPhpDoc will always return `mixed`

## Release logs
- v1.0.0
  - First version
  - View & Update phpDoc for a single Model at a time
- v1.1.0 (planned)
  - Bulk replace by namespace
