Quickly generate the phpDoc for your Eloquent Model. Make your Eloquent super friendly with IDEs (eg PHPStorm).

And maintaining the phpDoc of your models don't have to be a pain in the ass, should be:

- Fun
- Fast
- Reliable

And, welcome to Eloquent phpDoc Generator, which going to help you to achieve the 3 points above ðŸŽ‰

## What will Eloquent phpDoc Generator will generate?
- Table name
- Table columns (with correct types - including Casting types ðŸ˜Ž)
- Model relationships
- Model attributes/accessors

## Available For / Requirements

- **v2.x**: Laravel 11, PHP 8.2+.
- **v1.x**: Laravel 9/10, PHP 8.0, 8.1.

## Install
Install as dev-dependencies is enough, since you are only going to use this command on `local/development` env.

```bash
composer require sethphat/eloquent-docs --dev
```

Laravel auto-discovery will automatically do the magic for you.

## Use the command

```bash
php artisan eloquent:phpdoc "App\Models\User" # view only
php artisan eloquent:phpdoc "App\Models\User" --write # view & write to file
php artisan eloquent:phpdoc "App\Models\User" --short-class # new option - use short class instead of full namespace path

# from v1.2.0
php artisan eloquent:bulk-phpdoc "app/Models/*.php" # bulk generation (force write mode)
```

Result:

<details>

```bash
====== Start PHPDOC scope of App\Models\User
/**

*/
====== End PHPDOC scope of App\Models\User
Wrote phpDoc scope to /<my-path>/app/Models/User.php
Thank you for using EloquentDocs!
```

</details>

## Best practices
- Use `$casts` in your model, in order to help EloquentPhpDoc generate better types for you (array, date, datetime,...)
- For `get*Attribute` accessor, always declare the return type

Note: for Eloquent new `Attribute` class utilize the data via Closure, making it impossible to acquire the return types. 
For this case, EloquentDocs will always return `mixed`
